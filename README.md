# adventofcode

My 'Advent of Code' solutions, written in C#.
Started in 2019, and made it part way through.
Excited to try and get through 2020!

### commands
#### help
  - lists all days available to run
#### year.day
  - runs the corresponding day for that year
  - eg. '2020.1'

### info
Create a new BaseDay instance named 'Day#' and fill out the abstract implementation.
The day will be auto detected by the program and be available to run.
GetSolution() should return your answer for that day.
